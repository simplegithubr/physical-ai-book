# Research on Gazebo-Unity Integration Best Practices

## Original Prompt
Research best practices for integrating Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation in an educational context. Focus on:

1. How Gazebo and Unity typically work together in robotics projects
2. Common approaches for connecting Gazebo physics simulation with Unity visualization
3. Patterns for handling sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU) across both platforms
4. Recommended folder structures for organizing content in a Docusaurus-based book
5. Best practices for creating educational content around these technologies

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive documentation covering:

- Integration architecture and communication patterns
- Sensor simulation techniques for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Educational pedagogical approaches and course structures
- Recommended folder organization for Docusaurus documentation
- Best practices for educational content creation

The documentation is organized in a Docusaurus-based book structure with proper navigation and follows established patterns for technical documentation in educational contexts.
