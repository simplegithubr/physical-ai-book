## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **AI Tool Limitations**: Potential for inaccurate or inconsistent AI-generated content
   - *Mitigation*: Strong human oversight and validation processes
2. **Technical Complexity**: Docusaurus customization and integration challenges
   - *Mitigation*: Early technical prototyping and proof-of-concept work
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Ambitious scope for the allocated timeframe
   - *Mitigation*: Phased delivery with minimum viable product approach

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Resource Availability**: Potential for team member unavailability
   - *Mitigation*: Cross-training and backup resource planning
2. **Quality Standards**: Maintaining consistent quality across multiple authors
   - *Mitigation*: Standardized templates and rigorous validation processes
3. **Technology Changes**: Updates to Docusaurus or AI tools during development
   - *Mitigation*: Regular monitoring and flexible implementation approach
