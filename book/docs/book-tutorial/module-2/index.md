# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore the creation of physics-based digital twins using Gazebo for simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization. This module covers the integration of both platforms to simulate realistic environments and robotic systems.

## Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing, validation, and optimization of robotic applications in a simulated environment. This module combines:

- **Gazebo**: Physics-based simulation engine for accurate dynamics and sensor modeling
- **Unity**: High-fidelity visualization and rendering for immersive experiences
- **Sensor Simulation**: Accurate modeling of LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU sensors

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Set up and configure Gazebo for physics-based simulation
2. Integrate Unity for high-quality visualization
3. Simulate various sensor types with realistic characteristics
4. Validate simulation results against real-world data
5. Create integrated workflows between Gazebo and Unity

## Chapter Structure

- **Chapter 1**: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- **Chapter 2**: Sensor Simulation and Modeling
- **Chapter 3**: Unity Visualization and Integration

Let's begin by exploring physics simulation fundamentals in Gazebo.
