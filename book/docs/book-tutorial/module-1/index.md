# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the foundation of modern robotics: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). This module serves as your introduction to the robotic nervous system that enables communication, coordination, and control across robotic platforms.

## Overview

ROS 2 is the backbone of modern robotics development, providing a flexible framework for writing robot software. In this module, you'll learn:

- The fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- How to integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy
- How to describe robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand and implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
2. Create Python-based control nodes using rclpy
3. Build and understand humanoid robot models using URDF
4. Connect robot descriptions to ROS 2 control systems

## Chapter Structure

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Foundations - Understanding the core concepts
- **Chapter 2**: Python Integration with Robotics - Bridging AI and robotics
- **Chapter 3**: Humanoid Structure & URDF - Describing robots in code

Let's begin by exploring the foundational concepts of ROS 2.
